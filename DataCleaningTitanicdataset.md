Data cleaning and Wrangling operations for titanic dataset
Using the Titanic dataset from this Kaggle competition.

This dataset contains information about 891 people who were on board the ship when departed on April 15th, 1912. As noted in the description on Kaggle's website, some people aboard the ship were more likely to survive the wreck than others. There were not enough lifeboats for everybody so women, children, and the upper-class were prioritized. Using the information about these 891 passengers, the challenge is to build a model to predict which people would survive based on the following fields:

Name (str) - Name of the passenger
Pclass (int) - Ticket class
Sex (str) - Sex of the passenger
Age (float) - Age in years
SibSp (int) - Number of siblings and spouses aboard
Parch (int) - Number of parents and children aboard
Ticket (str) - Ticket number
Fare (float) - Passenger fare
Cabin (str) - Cabin number
Embarked (str) - Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
